******************
Creating a Package
******************

In this section we will describe how to create an EAGERx package, in this case the eagerx_ode package.
This package will contain the OdeEngine for simulating systems based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
Since the OdeEngine will be a generic engine that can be useful for others, we will create a public repository for the OdeEngine.
